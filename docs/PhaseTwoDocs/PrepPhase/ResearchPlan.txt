General Overview:
    Goals of Research:
        -> Learn more about the design of processors/compilers
        -> Determine solutions to anticipated logistical problems
            (Problems may be rooted in design or in testing/devloping)
            (Solutions should ease constraints or bolster abilities/quality)
        -> Be able to trace/apply research learnings to phase ii designs

    Main Research Approaches:
        -> Conduct self-studying on main topics (videos, books, etc)
            (Self-studying can include online videos/aticles and physical books)
            ("Case study" compilers/processors are a form of self study)
            (Studying will likely be interdependent with other approaches)
        -> "Interview" seasoned engineers for insight, advice, and direction
        -> Put together smaller models to gain "hands-on" knowledge

================================================================================
Additional Detailed Thoughts:
    Software Research:
        -> Compiler is based on C and GCC standards- good starting point
            (Pick a C and GCC version to officially mimic for consistency)
            (Open source GCC versions exist as living case studies)
            (Other compilers like clang or XC8 would help round out ideas)
        -> Break components down by functionality and rate by necessity
        -> Check with seasoned colleagues about testing/developing logistics
    
    Hardware Research:
        -> FPGA selection/logistics are crucial- invest time into this topic
        -> Given no "base" processor, design research should include breadth
            (Consider used/owned dev kits for processor case studies)
            (ISA case studies include x86, ARM, RISC, PIC, etc)
            (Keep size/goals of RISCII processor in mind when choosing studies)
        -> Consider future ambitions while standards (eg ISA) are defined
