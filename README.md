# Project-RISCII
Project RISCII (pronounced "risky"- no affiliation to RISC-II) is a personal project focused on designing as many aspects of an embedded system as possible (namely a processor and compiler).

## Hardware Design
Hardware design includes a pipelined processor with two L1 caches (one for instructions and data, each). See [/hardware](https://github.com/NerfJohn/Project-RISCII/blob/main/hardware) for more details.

## Software Design
Software design includes a single file C compiler that creates .hex files compatible with the hardware design's processor. See [/software](https://github.com/NerfJohn/Project-RISCII/blob/main/software) for more details.

## Documentation
See [/docs](https://github.com/NerfJohn/Project-RISCII/blob/main/docs) for project documentation.
