# Project RISCII
*"Personally designed dev kit"*

---

Project RISCII (pronounced "risky"- not RISC-II) is a personal project focused on designing the breadth an embedded system from scratch. The primary 'levels' include:

- low-level drivers and libraries
- compiler
- (softcore) microprocessor
- circuit board

This project is ultimately for personal enjoyment. ***However***, if there is educational or commerical value, it is free for use (albeit at the user's risk).

## Current Trajectory

The main pushes at the time of this writing are:

1. Creating a circuit board design
2. Writing drivers/libraries- including simple RTOS + SW upgrade concept
3. Cleanup/tidy project pieces

The circuit board is slated for summer 2025 (with the compiler/libraries finished before/after then). Time is also being put into tidy-ing up various pieces for readability and/or functionality.
