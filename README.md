# Project RISCII
*"Personally designed dev kit"*

---

Project RISCII (pronounced "risky"- not RISC-II) is a personal project focused on designing an embedded system from scratch. The primary 'levels' include:

- low-level drivers and libraries
- compiler
- (softcore) microprocessor
- circuit board

This project is ultimately for personal enjoyment. ***However***, if there is educational or commerical value, it is free for use (albeit at the user's risk).

## Current Trajectory

The main pushes at the time of this writing are:

1. Finishing the basic C(esque) compiler
2. Creating a circuit board design
3. Refactoring compiler for simplicity

The circuit board is slated for summer 2025 (with the compiler/libraries finished before/after then). Compiler refactoring is being worked on to make compiling more approachable from a readability/educational perspective.
