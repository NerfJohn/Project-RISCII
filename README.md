# Project RISCII
---

Project RISCII (pronounced "risky"- no affiliation with RISC-II) is a personal project focused on designing an embedded system. The current scope includes the following "levels":
- low-level drivers and libraries
- compiler
- microprocessor
- circuit board

*Note: This project is 1) ultimately for personal enjoyment and 2) in no way meant to be a commercial/professional product. Use/reference at your own risk.*

## Status: Phase II Release- Microprocessor with Sample Assembler/Linker

The softcore microprocessor deisgn has been completed. An assembler/linker program (albeit with rough documentation) has also been developed and used in testing of the microprocessor.

The microprocessor can be found under [/processor/DevProject](./processor/DevProject). The sample assembler/linker can be found under [/compiler/AsmldProject](./compiler/AsmldProject).

## Next Steps: Phase II 1/2- Compiler Backend + Shape-up

The next stage of the compiler, the back-end, is the next step. Also, better documentation of the assembler/linker and overall plan for the compiler (ie features/division of tasks/etc) will be worked on.
