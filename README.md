# Project-RISCII
Project RISCII (pronounced "risky"- no affiliation to RISC-II) is a personal project focused on designing as many aspects of an embedded system as possible (namely a processor and compiler).


## Status: Phase II- Processor and Assembler/Linker Design
Having design a working compiler/processor prototype (see tag [phase_i](https://github.com/NerfJohn/Project-RISCII/tree/phase_i)), work has moved onto designing the processor FPGA source code (under [/processor](./processor)) and the assembler/linker (designed, for simplicity, as one piece under [/compiler](./compiler)).
